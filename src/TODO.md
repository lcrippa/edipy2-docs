- [x]  Check all calculations to evaluate mixed and anomalous Green's functions.  
  *Note that in* **superc** *a different defintion of the  linear combination of operators* $P_{\alpha\beta}=c_\alpha - i c^+_\beta$​​ *leads to a different algebraic manipulation of the mixed orbital Green's function, i.e. with a term* $(1-i)$​ *rather than* $(1+i)$​​​. 
- [x] Include Poles and Weights storage for quick re-evalutation of the impurity Green's function and impurity Self-Energy. 

- [ ] Extend **normal** and **superc** GF calculations to full algorithm, without assuming any symmetry among components. 

- [ ] Extend the **superc** mode to include spin-dependency. 

- [x] Extend **superc** to use *replica* bath type

- [x] Extend replica case to orbital-dependent hybridization V_k => `bath_type=general`

- [ ] Extend ED_SECTOR=T to **superc** mode
