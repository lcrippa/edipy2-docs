Dependencies
============

The EDIpack2.0 code relies on:

* `SciFortran <https://github.com/aamaricci/SciFortran>`_ : an
  external library  providing a simple and generic environment for
  scientific software development, *in a way* just like ``scipy`` for
  ``python``.  

* `MPI <https://github.com/open-mpi/ompi>`_ : a distributed memory
  parallel communication layer including Fortran compiler.
